/*

Problem Statement 

You are required to implement the following function:

Int Calculate(int m, int n);

The function accepts 2 positive integer ‘m’ and ‘n’ as its arguments.You are required to calculate the sum of numbers divisible both by 3 and 5, between ‘m’ and ‘n’ both inclusive and return the same.
Note
0 < m <= n

Example

Input:
m : 12
n : 50

Output
90

Explanation:
The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 both inclusive are {15, 30, 45} and their sum is 90.
Sample Input
m : 100
n : 160
Sample Output
510
